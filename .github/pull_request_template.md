## Pull Request Instructions

### Titles

Titles should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification _(like Commit Messages, and because Pull Requests titles can be used as Commit Messages too)_

### Drafts

It is a best practice to open a Draft Pull Request as soon as possible (when the first commit of a new branch has been pushed)

### Linked Related Issues

Unless trivial, each Pull Request marked as Ready for Review should have a linked related issue

### Topics

Pull Request Comments are dedicated to discussions about its specific implementation;  
For the conception and general implementation, please use the respective linked related Issues;  
For anything else, please use Discussions.
